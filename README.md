# Mixed Features React App
in this test **`react app`** I've tried to combine most of the ```features, libraries and hooks``` you would ever use in you **`react application`**.

among other things there is: 
* product list with search and Only in stock features;
* classic todo list, that loads data from fake api server. you can manipulate with your todos: load, add, remove, change, mark/unmark as completed so on;
* login/logout emulation. you have to be logged in in order to get access to todo page;
* most of the react hooks plus few custom;
* online shop orders history light verssion with items loaded, items descriptions on item click, orders history. login/logout simulation, so on. 
>to see this part you have to switch App.js with !App.js from app root; 
* and many more;
