# Mixed Features React App
in this test **`react app`**, I've tried to combine most of the ```features, libraries and hooks``` that were available at the beginning of 2022.

among other things, there is: 
* a product list with search and Only in stock features;
* a classic todo list, that loads data from fake api server. you can manipulate with your todos: load, add, remove, change, mark/unmark as completed so on;
* login/logout emulation. you have to be logged in in order to get access to todo page;
* most of the react hooks plus few custom ones;
* an online shop orders history light verssion with loaded items, item descriptions on item click, orders history. login/logout simulation, so on. 
>to see this part you have to switch from App.js to !App.js in the app root; 
* and many more;
